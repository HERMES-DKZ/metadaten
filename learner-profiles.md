This lesson is being developed specifically for researchers in the humanities and cultural studies and is designed for learners with no prior experience in data and metadata concepts. Since data and metadata are foundational not only to all forms of research but also to knowledge organization, digital preservation, and cultural heritage management, understanding them is essential for anyone working with sources, archives, museums, digital collections, or structured information. Whether dealing with historical documents, artworks, or cultural datasets, the ability to interpret, organize, and manage metadata supports research transparency, reproducibility, and interoperability, while also playing a crucial role in curating and preserving cultural knowledge.  

This lesson provides a starting point for those new to these topics, introducing basic principles and practical applications relevant to humanities research and GLAM institutions. No technical background is requiredâ€”only curiosity and a willingness to explore how metadata shapes knowledge production and access in the digital age.
